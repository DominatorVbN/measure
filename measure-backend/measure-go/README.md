Rest of the README would be written soon. Stay tuned.

## Notable points

1. All code will be under `package main` until we figure out best package organization based on responsibility
2. All environment variables _MUST_ have a sensible default value targetted towards local setup
3. Contributors are expected to copy `.env.example` to `.env` file and modify values as needed for production
